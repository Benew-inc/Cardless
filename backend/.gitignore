## Node backend hygiene (CRITICAL)
# `node_modules/` must never be committed in professional systems:
# - Not portable across OS/CPU/Node versions; causes non-reproducible builds.
# - Bloats repos and slows audits/reviews (financial systems require tight change control).
# - Dependency state must be reproduced from `package.json` + lockfile, not from vendored artifacts.
